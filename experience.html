            After graduating from the University of Connecticut in 2014, I began working as a Nursing Assistant to gain
            clinical experience. I worked for a very supportive and internal-growth focused Senior Living provider who,
            after 9 months on the job, gave me the opportunity to step into a leadership role. 
            <br><br>
            Over 8 years and between 3 different communities, I held the roles of Assisted Living Manager, Associate
            Executive Director, and Executive Director.
             <br><br>
            My professional skills include: management and leadership, budgeting and business planning, effective communication,
            sales and marketing strategies, and strong interpersonal skills.
            <br><br>
            In June 2022, I decided it was time to pivot my career in a new direction. I enrolled
            in General Assembly's Immersive Software Engineering Bootcamp and will be graduating in October 2022.
