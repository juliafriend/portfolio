Greeting Page
I began this project by creating a simple greeting page.  I kept
the H1 "Julia Friend" and body the same on all 4 HTML pages for continuity. The pictures were added to imgur so that their links could easily be copied in. The Biography,
Experience, and Projects links are simple anchor tags that link my main Index page to the other html files. The navigation bar at the bottom also utilizes anchor tags that link to external pages.

JS Interactions
All 3 can be seen on the greeting page. 
1) The carousel of pictures- I was able to create this using the W03d01 instructor example for guidance. I uploaded all pictures to imgur.com so it was an easy link to copy in.
2) On the nav bar, there is an "on.click" function that changes the background to pink when clicked. 
3) The button on the bottom of the page also uses an "on.click" function to print a message
when clicked. 
I did play around with a hover feature but couldn't get it to work on just 1, individual link. I found it annoying when it blinked all 3 links when hovered, so I switched to the color changing function instead.

Bio, Experience, and Project Pages
These are pretty simple and carry over the H1 and body from the greeting page. I added an H2, one picture from the carousel, a div with text, and the nav bar. I added a link to "home" on the nav bar on these pages so the user could return to the greeting page.

Media Queries
Most of my styling looked okay on all screen sizes. The things I had to adjust with a media query were:
-the font size of page links so they would remain on one line as the screen size shrunk
-I shrunk the nav links so they would still be smaller than the page links
-the width of the pictures and boxes around them as the page shrunk or grew

Styling
I grabbed a simple font from google fonts and a color pallette from coolors.co for the accent colors. I was able to style and center the carousel, page links, nav bar, and button by using containers and/or flexboxes.
